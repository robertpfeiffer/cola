<h2>Introduction</h2>

Jolt is a cardboard cut-out of a Coke: a higher-order, functional
abstract syntax processor and assembler.  It is included in the
idst5.4 distribution in the '<tt>examples/jolt</tt>' directory.  The
main difference between Jolt and Coke is in the back-end: Coke's
back-end is written in Pepsi/Coke whereas Jolt avoids the problem by
using the VPU as a portable back-end.


<h2>Compiling and installing</h2>

Type <blockquote><pre>make</pre></blockquote> in
the <tt>examples/jolt</tt> directory of the idst release.  If you want
to exercise it, type <blockquote><pre>make run</pre></blockquote>
or run <blockquote><pre>./main</pre></blockquote>
for an interactive prompt.

<h2>Syntax</h2>

Coke programs are constructed from a small number of syntactic
elements: constants (numbers, strings), identifiers (for variables and
user-defined parse node rules), strings (arrays of characters), and
lists (representing parse tree nodes and their children).

<h3>Numbers</h3>

Integers consist of an optional sign followed by one or more digits.
Only decimal integers are supported.

<p> Floating-point numbers consist of an optional sign, one or more
digits, a decimal point, zero or more digits, and an optional exponent
consisting of a single letter '<tt>e</tt>' and an integer.  Only
decimal floating-point numbers are supported.
  
  <blockquote>
    Note: Jolt does not currently support floating-point numbers.
  </blockquote>

<h3>Strings</h3>

Strings begin with a double-quote character '<tt>&quot;</tt>' followed
by zero or more characters and end with a double-quote character.  The
initial and final double-quote characters delimit the string but are
not included in its contents.  Backslash characters introduce 'escape
sequences' within a string, as follows:

  <blockquote>
    <table>
	<tr><td><tt>\a</tt></td><td>'bel' (ASCII code 7)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\b</tt></td><td>backspace (ASCII code 8)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\e</tt></td><td>escape (ASCII code 27)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\f</tt></td><td>form feed (ASCII code 12)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\n</tt></td><td>newline (ASCII code 10)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\r</tt></td><td>carriage return (ASCII code 13)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\t</tt></td><td>horizontal tab (ASCII code 9)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\v</tt></td><td>vertical tab (ASCII code 11)</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>\nnn</tt></td><td>octal character nnn (ASCII code 0nnn)</td></tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

Identifiers consist of one or more letters, digits or characters from
the set <tt>!#$%&*./:<=>?@\^_|~+-</tt> (where the initial character
cannot be a digit).  Ambiguity between identifiers and numbers are
resolved in favour of the number.

<h3>Lists</h3>

Lists consist of an initial opening parenthesis '<tt>(</tt>', zero or
more syntactic elements (as described in this section), and a
terminating closing parenthesis '<tt>)</tt>'.

<h3>Comments</h3>

A semicolon (appearing outside a string literal) introduces a comment.
The semicolon and everything following it on the same line is
discarded by the scanner and ignored.  Comments count as blank space.

<h3>Artificial sweeteners</h3>

Certain operators are so frequently used that they merit dedicated
abbreviated syntax in the scanner.

<!--h4>Quotation</h4-->

In the following quotation-related 'syntactic sugar', <i>element</i>
can be any syntactic element described in this section:

  <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>'<i>element</i></tt></dt>
      <dd>(single quote) is equivalent to <tt>(quote <i>element</i>)</tt></dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>`<i>element</i></tt></dt>
      <dd>(backquote) is equivalent to <tt>(quasiquote <i>element</i>)</tt></dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>,<i>element</i></tt></dt>
      <dd>(comma) is equivalent to <tt>(unquote <i>element</i>)</tt></dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>,@<i>element</i></tt></dt>
      <dd>(comma followed by commercial at) is equivalent to <tt>(unquote-splicing <i>element</i>)</tt></dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>

<!--h4>Message send</h4-->

Interaction with (sending messages to) the objects that describe
program structures and the compiler environment is supported by the
following syntactic sugaring:

<blockquote><tt>[ <i>receiver selector [arguments...]</i> ]</tt></blockquote>

is equivalent to

<blockquote><tt>( send (quote <i>selector</i> ) <i>receiver [arguments...]</i> )</tt></blockquote>

(where no attempt is made to impose the correct number of arguments
for the selector provided).  Note that the syntactic sugar quotes the
selector for you (if you need to compute the selector, use
the <tt>send</tt> form directly).  Note also that the <tt>send</tt>
form and the <tt>[...]</tt> syntax have the receiver and selector in a
different order.<p>

For keyword selectors one more feature is provided:

<blockquote><tt>[ <i>receiver keyword1: argument1 keyword2: argument2 ...</i> ]</tt></blockquote>

is equivalent to

<blockquote><tt>( send (quote <i>keyword1:keyword2:...</i> ) <i>receiver argument1 argument2 ...</i> )</tt></blockquote>

with the individual <tt>keyword</tt> parts collected into a single
selector.  This feature makes unary, binary and keyword message syntax
entirely compatible with traditional Smalltalk syntax.

<h2>Semantics</h2>

Semantics are apparent in the evaluation rules of syntactic elements
(their run-time meaning or effect) and in the treatment of compound
forms (lists with particular structure or contents) that have special
(or user-defined) syntactic or semantic meaning during the compilation
process.

<h3>Evaluation rules</h3>

Numbers evaluate to the primitive (non-object) representation of their
value.

<p> Strings evaluate to a primitive (non-object) pointer to an array
of characters terminated with a nul character.

<p> Identifiers always represent an <i>r-value</i> (some physical
  location associated with the identifier during the execution of the
  code in which the identifier appears).  When they appear outside
  special syntactic forms they evaluate to the
  associated <i>l-value</i> -- the value stored in the physical
  location associated with the identifier.

<p> Lists (that are not special syntactic or semantic forms, as
described below) represent the application of a function value to zero
or more argument values.  The form

  <blockquote><tt>( <i>function [arguments...]</i> )</tt></blockquote>

evaluates the <i>function</i> and <i>arguments</i> (if present) in an
<b>unspecified</b> order.  The result of evaluating <i>function</i>
must be a function (native code) address that is called with the
evaluated <i>arguments</i>.

<h3>Intrinsic operators</h3>

<p> Certain built-in operators behave like functions but are not
evaluated as identifiers.  (Their arguments are evaluated exactly as
descried above.)

<p> The intrinsic arithmetic and relational operators are as follows:

  <blockquote>
    <table>
      <tr><td><tt>( + <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>addition of two or more arguments</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( - <i>arg</i> )</tt></td><td>negation of a single argument</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( - <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>subtraction of two or more arguments</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( * <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>multiplication of two or more arguments</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( / <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>division of two or more arguments</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( % <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>remainder after division of two or more arguments</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( &lt; <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>non-zero iff first argument less than second argument</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;= &gt;= &gt;</tt></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... idem for other (in)equalities</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( == <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>non-zero iff arguments identical</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tt>( != <i>args...</i> )</tt></td><td>non-zero iff arguments not identical</td></tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

<p> Pointers behave like (long) integers.  Pointer dereferencing is
provided for the traditional machine types:

  <blockquote>
    <tt>( char@  <i>address [index]</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( short@ <i>address [index]</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( int@   <i>address [index]</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( long@  <i>address [index]</i> )</tt></blockquote>

evaluates to the integer (char, short, int or long, sized according to
local platform conventions) stored at the given <i>address</i> in
memory.  If the optional <i>index</i> is present, it is first scaled
by the size of the addressed value (typically by 1, 2, 4 or 8) and
then added to the base <i>address</i> to yield the effective address
for the operation.  The related forms

  <blockquote>
    <tt>( set-char@  <i>address [index] value</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( set-short@ <i>address [index] value</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( set-int@   <i>address [index] value</i> )</tt><br>
    <tt>( set-long@  <i>address [index] value</i> )</tt></blockquote>

write <i>value</i> into a location whose effective address is
calculated as just described.  (These 'setter' forms need not be
written explicitly; see the <tt>set</tt> form described below.)  The
form as a whole yields <i>value</i> as its result.

<h3>Special forms</h3>

Special forms are list structures that disobey the usual evaluation
rules for lists, typically by not evaluating (or by evaluating
unusually) one or more of their elements.

  <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>( and <i>args...</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates each of the <i>args</i> from left to right until
	one of them yields zero; <i>args</i> to the right of the
	first zero value are not evaluated.  The result of the
	overall form is non-zero iff all <i>args</i> yield
	non-zero.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( or <i>args...</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates each of the <i>args</i> from left to right until
	one of them yields non-zero; <i>args</i> to the right of the
	first non-zero value are not evaluated.  The result of the
	overall form is zero iff all <i>args</i> yield
	zero.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( if <i>condition consequent [alternate]</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates the <i>condition</i> and then either
	the <i>consequent</i> (if the <i>condition</i> was non-zero)
	or the <i>alternate</i> (if present).  The result of the
	overall form is the result of whichever of <i>consquent</i>
	and <i>alternate</i> is evaluated.  If <i>alternate</i> is
	not present and <i>condition</i> is zero then the overall
	result is zero.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( while <i>condition [args...]</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>while the <i>condition</i> evaluates to non-zero, all
	the <i>args</i> are evaluated in order, left to right.  This
	process continues until <i>condition</i> evaluates to zero,
	causing the overall form to yield zero.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( let ( <i>[bindings...]</i> ) <i>[args...]</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates each of the <i>args</i> in order, left to right,
	in an environment augmented by the result of evaluating
	the <i>bindings</i>.  Each <i>binding</i> has the form
	<blockquote><tt>( <i>identifier</i> <i>value</i> )</tt></blockquote>
	where <i>value</i> is evaluated according to the usual rules
	before being bound to <i>identifier</i> during the evaluation
	of the <i>args</i>.  The identifiers are added to the
	environment before evaluating and binding their values (which
	is a bug and will be fixed sometime in the near future).  The
	overall result is the value of the last of the <i>args</i>; if
	no <i>args</i> are present then the overall value is
	zero.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( set <i>identifier value</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates <i>value</i> and then assigns it to the location
      associated with the r-value <i>identifier</i>.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( set ( <i>identifier args...</i> ) <i>value</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>does not cause any evaluation.  It simply rewrites itself in
      the form
	<blockquote><tt>( set-<i>identifier</i> <i>args... value</i> )</tt></blockquote>
	and re-evaluates the resulting form.  This permits any field or slot 'getter'
	to be converted into a corresponding 'setter' by enclosing the getter expression
	in a <tt>set</tt> form.  For example, the expression
	<blockquote><tt>( set ( long@ address ) 42 )</tt></blockquote>
	is rewritten as
	<blockquote><tt>( set-long@ address 42 )</tt></blockquote> by
	the compiler and then immediately re-evaluated to effect the assignment.
      </dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( lambda ( <i>[formal...]</i> ) <i>[expr...]</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates to the address of a function accepting zero or
	more <i>formal</i> arguments, where each <i>formal</i> must be
	an identifier.
	<p>When applied, the function value of a <tt>lambda</tt>
	  expression evaluates each of its <i>expr</i>s in order, from
	  left to right, in an environment in which each <i>formal</i>
	  names a variable bound to a corresponding actual argument
	  supplied in the function application.  The value of the applied
	  function is the value of the final <i>expr</i>; if
	  no <i>expr</i> is present then the function returns zero.
	<p>Note: The evaluation of a <tt>lambda</tt> yields a
	  function that can be applied; the <i>expr</i>s are <b>not</b>
	  evaluated until the function result of <tt>lambda</tt> is
	  applied to zero or more actual arguments as explained for the
	  evaluation of lists above.  A given function value can be
	  applied any number of times and obeys the local platform's C
	  ABI conventions; it can therefore be passed as a callback
	  'function pointer' to statically-compiled library and OS
	  routines.</dd>
      <dt><tt>( return <i>value</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>appearing in the body <tt>lambda</tt> function
	evaluates <i>value</i> and then immediately returns control to
	the function's caller yielding <i>value</i> as the result of the
	function application.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( define <i>identifier value</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates <i>value</i>, creates a variable binding
	for <i>identifier</i> in the current scope, and assigns the
	value to the variable.  If the form appears as a top-level
	expression then the binding is created in the current global
	environment.  If the form appears within a <tt>let</tt>
	or <tt>lambda</tt> expression then the binding is created as a
	local (automatic) variable within that expression.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( syntax <i>identifier function</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>is similar to <tt>define</tt> except that
	the <i>function</i> value must evaluate to an applicable
	function address.  The <i>identifier</i> names a new abstract
	syntax tree node type with the <i>function</i> providing the
	compilation rules for any node of the newly-created type.
	(The scoping rules for the binding are identical to those
	of <tt>define</tt>).  See the section below
	on <a href="#syntactix">abstract syntax definitions</a> for
	further explanation of the <i>function</i> argument.</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( quote <i>element</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates to an object corresponding to the compiler's
	internal representation for <i>element</i>.  (This object can be
	incorporated into abstract syntax trees passed to the compiler
	for evaluation and compilation.)</dd>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt><tt>( send <i>message receiver [args...]</i> )</tt></dt>
      <dd>evaluates <i>message</i>, <i>receiver</i> and <i>args</i>
	(if present).  The <i>message</i> must evaluate to an
	identifier and <i>receiver</i> to a compiler object.  The
	<i>message</i> identifier is then sent as a message to
	the <i>receiver</i> object along with any <i>args</i>
	supplied.  The overall value of the form is the (object)
	answered by the message send.</dd>
    </dl>

<a name="primitix"><h2>Primitives</h2>

Primitives appear as applicable function addresses bound in the
top-level (global) environment.  Only one primitive is provided:

<blockquote><tt>( _dlsym <i>handle symbol</i> )</tt></blockquote>

evaluates <i>symbol</i> to yield a string and <i>handle</i> to yield an
integer representing a library or process namespace.  The primitive
returns the address of the code or data location associated with the
symbol in the namespace.

<p> Which namespaces are searched depends on the handle parameter.
If <i>handle</i> is zero then every namespace associated with the
process and its dynamic libraries is searched in the order they were
loaded.  If <i>handle</i> is associated with a library opened with the
library function <tt>dlopen</tt> then only that library (and any
libraries it depends on) are searched for the <i>symbol</i>.

<p> The <tt>_dlsym</tt> primitive returns zero if <i>symbol</i> cannot
be found, and sets an error condition which may be queried with the
<tt>dlerror</tt> library function.

<blockquote>Note: the library functions <tt>dlopen</tt>
and <tt>dlerror</tt> must be imported explicitly.  For example:
<blockquote><pre>(define _dlopen  (_dlsym 0 "dlopen"))
(define _dlerror (_dlsym 0 "dlerror"))
(define printf   (_dlsym 0 "printf"))
(define exit     (_dlsym 0 "exit"))

(syntax begin
  (lambda (form)
    `(let () ,@[form copyFrom: '1])))

(define dlopen
  (lambda (name)
    (let ((handle (_dlopen name 0)))
      (if handle
          handle
          (begin
            (printf "Error: dlopen: %s\n" (dlerror))
            (exit 1))))))</pre></blockquote></blockquote>


<a name="syntactix"><h2>Abstract syntax definitions</h2>

Abstract syntax tree node types defined with the <tt>syntax</tt> form
cause their associated function to be invoked whenever the compiler
encounters the corresponding node type during compilation.  The
function is passed two arguments: the abstract syntax tree <i>node</i>
that is currently being compiled (necessarily a list beginning with a
symbol corresponding to the node type name) and the compiler (an
object) that is compiling it.  A syntax definition therefore typically
has the following form:

<blockquote><pre>(syntax <i>type</i> (lambda (node compiler) <i>action...</i>))</pre></blockquote>

where <i>type</i> is the name of the defined node type
and <i>action...</i> are statements/expressions controlling the
compilation of the node.

<p> The <i>actions</i> are responsible for compiling the node.  Three
  mechanisms are available to the actions:
  <ul>
    <li> They can return an object (or more usually an object
      structure).  This object is recompiled in place of the original
      node.  For example:
      <blockquote><pre>(syntax begin
  (lambda (node compiler)
    `(let () ,@[node copyFrom: '1])))</pre></blockquote>
      defines a <tt>begin</tt> node type providing 'compound expressions'
      that evaluate several expressions in order and yield the value of
      their final expression.  The node is rewritten as a <tt>let</tt>
      and returned to the compiler for re-evaluation.
      <p> The node is sent <tt>copyFrom:</tt> to extract all but its
      first element (removing the <tt>begin</tt> from the start of the
      node) and the <tt>,@</tt> splices the result into a
      quasiquoted <tt>let</tt> expression.  The argument
      to <tt>copyFrom:</tt> must be an object (not a primitive value)
      hence the quoted integer.<p>
    </li>
    <li> They can ask any part of the node's substructure to compile
      itself normally, by sending it the message
      <blockquote><pre>[<i>anObject</i> compile: compiler]</pre></blockquote>
      (where <tt>compiler</tt> is the second argument passed to the
      syntax function).<p>
    </li>
    <li> They can emit low-level machine instructions via the
      compiler's back-end.  The interfaces to the back-ends are
      described in the next section.
    </li>
  </ul>

Any number of the above mechanisms can be combined to achieve the
desired implementation.  If the function completely generates the code
required for the ndoe it can return zero to inform the compiler that
no further compilation is needed for the node.  In this case the
function <b>must</b> generate (directly or indirectly)
precisely <b>one</b> value for the node.

<h3>Compiler back-end interfaces</h3>

Several back-end interfaces are available and/or planned.  The Jolt
prototype uses a VPU-like interface that generates code for PowerPC
and Intel processors.  The VPU instance generating code for the
compiler passed to a syntax function can be retrieved by sending
the <tt>compiler</tt> argument the message <tt>vpu</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>(syntax foo
  (lambda (node compiler)
    (let ((vpu [compiler vpu]))
      ...)))</pre></blockquote>

The vpu implements an abstract machine supporting a superset of C
semantics.  Three stacks are used.
<ul>
  <li> An <b>arithmetic stack</b> holds intermediate results of
    computations and arguments for function calls.  All operators pop
    their argument(s) from this stack and push their result onto this
    stack.
  <li> A completely seperate <b>variable stack</b> holds the state of
    local variables.  Local variables are created and destroyed on the
    top of this stack, and are referred to by integer index relative
    to the topmost variable.
  <li> Similarly, a completely seperate <b>label stack</b> holds local
    labels that can be used as targets for branch instructions.
    Labels are created and destroyed on the top of this stack, and are
    referred to by integer index relative to the topmost label.
</ul>

The vpu presents the following interface:

<blockquote>
<b>Management</b>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu new ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>creates a new instance of a vpu.  (This is normally not of
    interest, since the vpu passed to the syntax function indirectly
    through the compiler argument will be the correct instance to use
    for code generation.)<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu iTmp: <i>numTemps</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu iTmp ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes <i>numTemps</i> integer-valued temporary variables onto
    the variable stack.  In the second form, the
    missing <i>numTemps</i> is assumed to be one.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu dropTmp: <i>numTemps</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>removes the topmost <i>numTemps</i> variables from the variable
    stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu begin: <i>numLabels</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes <i>numLabels</i> local labels onto the label stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu end: <i>numLabels</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>removes the topmost <i>numLabels</i> local labels from the label
    stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu define: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>defines the <i>n</i>th local label (relative to the topmost) in
    the label stack to refer to the current 'program counter'
    location.  A local label must not be defined more than once.  A
    local label can be left undefined provided it is never used as the
    target of a branch instruction.<p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<b>Function prologue and epilogue</b>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu iEnter ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>declares the prologue for an integer-valued function.  This must
    be the first (non label defining) instruction in a function.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu iArg: <i>numArgs</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu iArg ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>declares <i>numArgs</i> integer-valued arguments.  Arguments
  must be declared immediately after the <tt>iEnter</tt> prologue and
  before any other instructions in the function body.  In the second
  form, the missing <i>numArgs</i> is assumed to be one.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu ret ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>returns the topmost item on the stack as the result of the
    function being compiled.  A <tt>ret</tt> always pops one item from
    the stack (the value returned), can occur any number of times in
    the body of a function, but must also be the last instruction in
    the function.<p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<b>Data movement</b>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu ldInt: <i>integer</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes <i>integer</i> (which must be an integer object value)
  onto the arithmetic stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu ldPtr: <i>object</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes the address of the given <i>object</i> onto the
  arithmetic stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu ldArg: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes the <i>n</i>th argument of the function being compiled
  onto the arithmetic stack.  Arguments are numbered from zero.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu stArg: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>stores the topmost item in the arithmetic stack into
  the <i>n</i>th argument of the function being compiled.  The item is
  not removed from the stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu ldTmp: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>pushes the contents of the <i>n</i>th local variable (relative
  to the top of the variable stack) onto the arithmetic stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu stTmp: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>stores the topmost item in the arithmetic stack into
  the <i>n</i>th local variable.  The item is not removed from the
  stack.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>[ vpu dup: <i>n</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu dup ]</tt></dt>

<a name="labelix"><h4>Global labels</h4>

When sent a <tt>compile</tt> message the vpu answers with the address
of the first instruction in the native code implementation of its
function.  However it is much more convenient to define a global label
associated with the entry point for the function:
<ul>
  <li>global labels implement a family of <tt>value</tt> methods that
    call their associated native code address with zero or more
    arguments; and
  </li>
  <li>global labels can be passed as the <i>label</i> argument in
    an <tt>iCall:label:</tt> instruction to provide the destination
    address for the function call; and
  </li>
  <li>global labels can be defined by looking up an external native
    code address in the running process, giving access to arbitray
    library and operating system functions.
  </li>
</ul>

The compiler provides the object type <tt>VPULabel</tt> for this
purpose.<p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>[ VPULabel new ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>answers a new, uninitialised global label.<p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>[ vpuLabel lookup: <i>symbol</i>]</tt></dt>
  <dd>defines the receiver as the address associated with the code or
    data object named by <i>symbol</i> (a string object) looked up in
    the process global namespace via <tt>_dlsym</tt> (see the section
    on <a href="#primitix">primitives</a>).<p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>[ vpu defineLabel: <i>label</i>]</tt></dt>
  <dd>defines the given global <i>label</i> to refer to the address of
    the next instruction generated in the receiver.<p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

(See also the <tt>iCall:label:</tt> instruction described earlier.)
Once defined, the function address associated with a global label can
be retrieved or invoked as follows:

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>[ vpuLabel _labelAddress ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>answers a primitive pointer equal to the defined address of the
    receiver.<p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>[ vpuLabel value ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>answers the result of calling the defined address of the
    receiver as a function with no arguments.<p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>[ vpuLabel value: <i>argument</i> ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>answers the result of calling the defined address of the
    receiver as a function with a single <i>argument</i>.<p>
  </dd>
</dl>
