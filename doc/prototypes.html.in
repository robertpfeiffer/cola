<a name="introductix"><h2>Introduction</h2>

This memo describes the addition of sideways composition
to <a href="pepsi.html">Pepsi</a> in the form of 'Lieberman-style'
prototypes.

<a name="introductix"><h3>Inheritance and delegation</h3>

Pepsi creates every object as a member of a particular <i>clone
family</i>.  A clone family provides its clones with their behaviour
and dictates their internal layout.  Modifying the behaviour of one
clone within a family causes the new behaviour to be adopted by all
members of the family.  (Modifying the layout of a clone is
effectively impossible once the initial 'examplar' of the family has
been defined.)  Since the layout of a clone is intimately related to
the methods that are allowed to run 'in' that clone (such as slot
getters and setters), the patterns of communication between clone
families within an inheritance hierarchy are rigid and fixed at the
point of their definition.  This is why inheritance occurs
between <i>vtables</i> (each a method dictionary shared by all members
of a family) in Pepsi.

<p> In Lieberman prototypes, delegation occurs between objects (not
between object behaviours).  Any object can delegate messages to any
other object at any time.  The entire chain of delegation between any
number of prototypes is considered a single <i>composite object</i>.
The meaning of <tt>self</tt> is independent of the number of times a
message has been delegated between prototypes since the original send.
Sending to <tt>self</tt> from any prototype within the composite
object causes the dispatch to begin again in the 'outermost'
prototype.

<p> Compared to inheritance, delegation is the more flexible and
general of the two techniques.  However, they both have their place within
an object model: inheritance for sharing of implementation state (and
the methods that act upon it) for a single prototype (within a
hierarchy of related prototype families), and delegation for sideways
composition of (independent and previously unrelated) prototypes into
a single logical composite object.  This is the position adopted (and
implemented) for sideways composition of Pepsi objects.

<a name="implem"><h2>Implementation</h2>

Two central concepts: receiver splitting and multi-dimensional dynamic
binding.

<h3>Receiver splitting</h3>

The <tt>self</tt> used for sending messages is dissociated from
the <tt>self</tt> used for accessing state.  The first identifies the
entire composite object and is always the first prototype in the
delegation chain regardless of how many times a given message has been
delegated within that chain.  The second identifies the particular
prototype (within the delegation chain) associated with the currently
executing method (physically holding the instance variables visible to
that method).

<p> Pepsi method signatures are augmented accordingly.  A method

<blockquote>
FamilyName messageName: arguments... [ ... ]
</blockquote>

previously declared by the compiler as

<blockquote><pre>
oop FamilyName__messageName(oop closure, oop self, arguments...) { ... }
</pre></blockquote>

is now declared as

<blockquote><pre>
oop FamilyName__messageName(oop closure, oop stateful_self, oop self, arguments...) { ... }
</pre></blockquote>

Within this method, sends of the form

<blockquote>
self selector: arguments...
</blockquote>

are compiled (as usual) as

<blockquote><pre>
_send(s_selector, self, arguments...)
</pre></blockquote>

whereas accesses to named instance variables that were previously compiled as

<blockquote><pre>
self->v_instVarName
</pre></blockquote>

are now compiled as

<blockquote><pre>
stateful_self->v_instVarName
</pre></blockquote>

The Lieberman-style prototypical delegation described above can be
effected by causing <tt>self</tt> and <tt>stateful_self</tt> to
diverge.  The former remains constant while the latter moves through
the delegation chain to record the particular prototype in which
delegated method lookup succeeded for the currently executing method.

<p> Both <tt>self</tt> and <tt>stateful_self</tt> are treated by the
compiler as normal method arguments.  If 'self' appears free in a
lexically-enclosed block then <tt>self</tt> will be assigned a slot in
the state vector of the block's defining context that is stored in the
closures created each time control passes the block's point of
definition in the program.  Similarly, if an instance variable appears
free in an inner block then <tt>stateful_self</tt> will be assigned to
a slot in the state vector, and hence captured and stored in all
closures associated with the block.  This guarantees correct (and
intuitively expected) behaviour of sends to 'self' and accesses to
state within arbitrarily-nested blocks of prototypical methods.


<h3>Multi-dimensional dynamic bind</h3>

The usual <i>inheritance chain</i> (between clone families) is
augmented by an orthogonal <i>delegation chain</i> (between arbitrary
objects).

<p> Message sends were previously implemented by code equivalent to

<blockquote><pre>
#define _send(MSG, RCV, ARG...) ({		\
  register oop _r= (RCV);			\
  struct __closure *_c= _bind((MSG), _r);	\
  (_c->method)((oop)_c, _r, ##ARG);		\
})
</pre></blockquote>

in which <tt>_bind()</tt> returns a single result: the closure in
which the method's implementation address is stored.  In order to
support prototypes the <tt>bind()</tt> function is augmented to
return two results: the closure in which the method implementation is
stored and the prototype in which the method binding was found.

<blockquote><pre>
struct __lookup {
  struct __closure *closure;
  oop               prototype;
};

#define _send(MSG, RCV, ARG...) ({					\
  register oop _r= (RCV);						\
  struct __lookup _l= _bind((MSG), _r);					\
  (_l.closure->method)((oop)_l.closure, _l.prototype, _r, ##ARG);	\
})
</pre></blockquote>

The last line passes the closure (as before) followed by the prototype
in which the bind succeeded (which becomes the <tt>stateful_self</tt>
in the invoked method) and the original receiver (which becomes
<tt>self</tt> in the invoked method and is the receiver for all sends
to 'self').

<p> The implementation of <tt>_bind()</tt> is extended from the
original one-dimensional lookup

<blockquote><pre>
struct __closure *_bind(oop selector, oop receiver)
{
  if (cache[receiver.vtable].selector == selector)
    return cache[receiver.vtable].closure;
  assoc := receiver.vtable.lookup(selector);
  if (assoc == nil)
    errorDoesNotUnderstand();
  cache[receiver.vtable].selector= selector;
  return cache[receiver.vtable].closure= assoc.closure;
}
</pre></blockquote>

to search the inheritance chain (as before) for each prototype in the delegation chain:

<blockquote><pre>
struct __lookup _bind(oop selector, oop receiver)
{
  do {
    if (cache[receiver.vtable].selector == selector)
      return (struct __lookup){ cache[receiver.vtable].closure, receiver };
    assoc := receiver.vtable.lookup(selector);
    if (assoc != nil) {
      cache[receiver.vtable].selector= selector;
      cache[receiver.vtable].closure= assoc.closure;
      return (struct __lookup){ assoc.closure, receiver };
    }
    receiver := receiver._delegate();  <i>/* message send */</i>
  } while (receiver != nil);
  errorDoesNotUnderstand();
}
</pre></blockquote>

Note that the delegate for a given prototype is obtained by sending it
a '_delegate' message.  The delegation chain can be defined by state
(have the method answer an instance variable) or by computation (have
the method compute and answer the desired next prototype object in the
delegation chain).  The default implementation of '_delegate'
installed in '_object' simply answers 'nil'.

<p> The overhead (once caches have settled) for this implementation
strategy is (on average) one method cache probe and one message send
for each step along the delegation chain.  The overhead for objects
that do not participate in prototypical delegation is essentially
zero: their '_delegate' method always returns <tt>nil</tt> and is only
ever invoked immediately before a guaranteed 'doesNotUnderstand'
situation.  No state whatsoever is added to these objects.

<p> The implementation overhead was a couple of tens of lines of code.

<a name="example"><h2>A short example</h2>

<blockquote><pre>
Prototype : Object ( next )

Prototype _delegate [ ^next ]

Prototype withDelegate: anObject
[
    self := self new.
    next := anObject.
]

A : Prototype ()

A a	[ 'A.a' putln ]

B : Prototype ()

B a	[ 'B.a' putln ]
B b	[ 'B.b ' put.  self a ]

C : Prototype ()

C c	[ 'C.c ' put.  self a; b ]

[
    | a |
    a := A withDelegate: (B withDelegate: C new).
    '======== a a:\n' put.  a a.
    '======== a b:\n' put.  a b.
    '======== a c:\n' put.  a c.
]
</pre></blockquote>

Executing the above program generates the following output:

<blockquote><pre>
======== a a:
A.a
======== a b:
B.b A.a
======== a c:
C.c A.a
B.b A.a
</pre></blockquote>


<a name="caveats"><h2>Caveats</h2>

Assigning to 'self' causes both <tt>self</tt>
and <tt>stateful_self</tt> to be assigned (the latter is 'tied' to the
former for the purposes of assignment).  This is necessary to
guarantee correct behaviour in 'constructor' methods.

<p> The default definition of 'new' clones only the first prototype in
the delegation chain.  This method must be overridden if all (or some
arbitrary portion) of the delegation chain is to be duplicated when
cloning the 'composite object' formed by them.

<p> I haven't (yet) figured out a syntax for 'resend', analagous to
'super' but for the delegation chain (rather than the inheritance
chain).


<a name="applix"><h2>Applications</h2>

Sideways composition.  (As described above.)

<p> Bullet-proof proxies, formed by a two-deep delegation chain in
which the first prototype is the proxy and the second is the object
'wrapped' by the proxy.  All sends to <tt>self</tt> within methods of
the wrapped object will be invoked on the enclosing proxy object.

<p> Layers and Context-Oriented Programming.  Supporting these
effectively was the principal motivation for adding 'Lieberman'
prototypes to Pepsi.

<p> Implementation object for JavaScript, Python and similar languages.

<p> Using 'here sends' to implement robust proxies (methods that
cannot be overriden in a more specific prototype within the composite
object).

<p> 'Perfect' encapsulation: no state whatsoever is visible between
prototypes.  Message sends are the only form of interaction between
prototypes.

<p> Mixins and supporting mechanism for traits, multiple inheritance,
etc.
