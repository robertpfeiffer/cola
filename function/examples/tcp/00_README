This example demonstrates an alternate 'shell' for Jolt and how to
build a tiny TCP/IP stack using it.

Parsing is performed by 'interpreting' a data structure created from a
parsing expression grammar (PEG).  The parser is bootstrapped in
parse.st which defines syntaxes for the Lisp-like Jolt language
(including the usual message-passing extension) and a PEG-like grammar
definition language.

New grammars are defined between curly braces { ... } and are
represented as literal grammar objects.  A grammar object, when
evaluated, generates a parser that immediately takes control of the
input stream.  The file structure.k contains an example of a grammar
for parsing 'ASCII art' to create data structure accessors.

NetworkPseudoInterface is a wrapper around /dev/tap and /dev/tun.  It
is horribly platform dependent.  The current version runs on Darwin as
long as third-party kernel extensions supporting tun/tap device
interfaces have been loaded.  For a known-working candidate see:

	   http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/tuntap/

The tunnel device is created dynamically and so the example shell MUST
be run as root.  The network side of the tunnel will show up at
10.0.0.2 unless you edit tcp.k (and/or tcp2.k) to change the address.

Quickstart:

1. In a window, do this:

	make
	sudo ./parse < boot.k

2. In another window, try each of the following:

	ping 10.0.0.2

	telnet 10.0.0.2 13
	<press ENTER key>

	open http://10.0.0.2
	<press RELOAD buton a few times>

Have fun!
